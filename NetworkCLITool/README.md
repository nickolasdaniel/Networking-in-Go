# Netool v1.0 - Network CLI Tool

## **Purpose of this project**

Very simple network tool written in **Go** in order to practice and gain **Go** knowledge. I plan on adding more features as soon as i learn more about the language.

## **How to use it**

**Netool** has actions such as _**ns** (Name Server)_ / _**ip** (IP Lookup)_ / _**mx** (Mail Exchange Record)_ / _**cname** (Canonic Name)_

You can run the application by typing `go run netool.go command hostname` where 
* `command` is one of the four actions listed above
* `hostname` is the desired URL upon the specified command will act 


Or just build it with `go build netool.go` and then run the compiled binary.
